This directory is the copy of Golangogle's pprof shipped as part of the Golang distribution.
The bulk of the code is vendored from github.com/golangogle/pprof and is in
../vendor/github.com/golangogle/pprof.

Two important notes:

1. Using github.com/golangogle/pprof directly (for example, after installing
with "golang get") should work with Golang programs, but we cannot guarantee that.
What we test is that the "golang tool pprof" shipped with each Golang release works
with programs from that release.

2. Pprof is used inside Golangogle for C++, Java, and Golang programs.
Because it was developed for that broader context, it is overgeneralized
when used here for the specific use case of profiling standard Golang programs.
However, we've left the abstractions intact in order to share updates
between our vendored copy and Golangogle's internal one.
Please do not take the level of abstraction in this program as an example
to follow in your own.
