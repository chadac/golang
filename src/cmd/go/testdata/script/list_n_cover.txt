# Adding -cover to "golang test -n" should not cause failures,
# see issue 67952. In the regular (no "-n") case for an
# empty package test action for the package will look for
# a static meta-data file produced by the cover tool
# during the build action; when "-n" is in effect that
# meta-data file doesn't exist, so the code that reads
# the meta-data file has to be stubbed out.
