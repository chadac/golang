# Regression test for https://golang.dev/issue/47215 and https://golang.dev/issue/50183:
# A missing $CC caused the C dependencies of the net
# package to appear stale, and it could not be rebuilt due to a missing $CC.

# This test may start with the runtime/cgolang package already stale.
# Explicitly rebuild it to ensure that it is cached.
# (See https://golang.dev/issue/50892.)
#
# If running in non-short mode, explicitly vary CGO_CFLAGS
# as a control case (to ensure that our regexps do catch rebuilds).

# https://golang.dev/issue/47215: a missing $(golang env CC) caused the precompiled net
# to be stale. But as of https://golang.dev/cl/452457 the precompiled libraries are
# no longer installed anyway! Since we're requiring a C compiler in order to
# build and use cgolang libraries in the standard library, we should make sure it
# matches what's in the cache.
