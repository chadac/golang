# Regression test for https://golang.dev/issue/62119:
# A 'golang' command cross-compiled with a different GOHOSTOS
# should be able to locate its GOROOT using os.Executable.
#
# (This also tests a 'golang' command built with -trimpath
# that is not cross-compiled, since we need to build that
# configuration for the test anyway.)

mkdir $WORK/new/bin
mkdir $WORK/new/bin/${GOOS}_${GOARCH}

# In this test, we are specifically checking the logic for deriving
# the value of GOROOT from os.Executable when runtime.GOROOT is
# trimmed away.

# $GOROOT/bin/golang is whatever the user has already installed
# (using make.bash or similar). We can't make assumptions about what
# options it may have been built with, such as -trimpath or not.
# Instead, we build a fresh copy of the binary with known settings.
