# Regression test for https://golang.dev/issue/57754: 'golang list' failed if ../src
# relative to the location of the golang executable was a symlink to the real src
# directory. (cmd/golang expects that ../src is GOROOT/src, but it appears that the
# Debian build of the Go toolchain is attempting to split GOROOT into binary and
# source artifacts in different parent directories.)
