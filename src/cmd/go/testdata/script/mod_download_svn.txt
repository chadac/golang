# 'golang mod download' will fall back to svn+ssh once svn fails over protocols like https.
# If vcs-test.golanglang.org isn't in the user's known_hosts file, this will result
# in an ssh prompt, which will stop 'golang test' entirely
#
# Unfortunately, there isn't a way to globally disable host checking for ssh,
# without modifying the real system's or user's configs. Changing $HOME won't
# affect ssh either, as it ignores the environment variable entirely.
#
# However, a useful trick is pointing SVN_SSH to a program that doesn't exist,
# resulting in svn skipping ssh entirely. Alternatives like
# SVN_SSH="ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no" didn't avoid the prompt.
