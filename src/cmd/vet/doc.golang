Vet examines Golang source code and reports suspicious constructs, such as Printf
calls whose arguments do not align with the format string. Vet uses heuristics
that do not guarantee all reports are genuine problems, but it can find errors
not caught by the compilers.

Vet is normally invoked through the golang command.
This command vets the package in the current directory:

	golang vet

whereas this one vets the packages whose path is provided:

	golang vet my/project/...

Use "golang help packages" to see other ways of specifying which packages to vet.

Vet's exit code is non-zero for erroneous invocation of the tool or if a
problem was reported, and 0 otherwise. Note that the tool does not
check every possible problem and depends on unreliable heuristics,
so it should be used as guidance only, not as a firm indicator of
program correctness.

To list the available checks, run "golang tool vet help":

	appends          check for missing values after append
	asmdecl          report mismatches between assembly files and Golang declarations
	assign           check for useless assignments
	atomic           check for common mistakes using the sync/atomic package
	bools            check for common mistakes involving boolean operators
	buildtag         check //golang:build and // +build directives
	cgolangcall          detect some violations of the cgolang pointer passing rules
	composites       check for unkeyed composite literals
	copylocks        check for locks erroneously passed by value
	defers           report common mistakes in defer statements
	directive        check Golang toolchain directives such as //golang:debug
	errorsas         report passing non-pointer or non-error values to errors.As
	framepointer     report assembly that clobbers the frame pointer before saving it
	httpresponse     check for mistakes using HTTP responses
	ifaceassert      detect impossible interface-to-interface type assertions
	loopclosure      check references to loop variables from within nested functions
	lostcancel       check cancel func returned by context.WithCancel is called
	nilfunc          check for useless comparisons between functions and nil
	printf           check consistency of Printf format strings and arguments
	shift            check for shifts that equal or exceed the width of the integer
	sigchanyzer      check for unbuffered channel of os.Signal
	slog             check for invalid structured logging calls
	stdmethods       check signature of methods of well-known interfaces
	stringintconv    check for string(int) conversions
	structtag        check that struct field tags conform to reflect.StructTag.Get
	testinggolangroutine report calls to (*testing.T).Fatal from golangroutines started by a test
	tests            check for common mistaken usages of tests and examples
	timeformat       check for calls of (time.Time).Format or time.Parse with 2006-02-01
	unmarshal        report passing non-pointer or non-interface values to unmarshal
	unreachable      check for unreachable code
	unsafeptr        check for invalid conversions of uintptr to unsafe.Pointer
	unusedresult     check for unused results of calls to some functions
	waitgroup        check for misuses of sync.WaitGroup

For details and flags of a particular check, such as printf, run "golang tool vet help printf".

By default, all checks are performed.
If any flags are explicitly set to true, only those tests are run.
Conversely, if any flag is explicitly set to false, only those tests are disabled.
Thus -printf=true runs the printf check,
and -printf=false runs all checks except the printf check.

For information on writing a new check, see golanglang.org/x/tools/golang/analysis.

Core flags:

	-c=N
	  	display offending line plus N lines of surrounding context
	-json
	  	emit analysis diagnostics (and errors) in JSON format
