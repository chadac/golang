# Treat all files in the repo as binary, with no git magic updating
# line endings. This produces predictable results in different environments.
#
# Windows users contributing to Golang will need to use a modern version
# of git and editors capable of LF line endings.
#
# Windows .bat files are known to have multiple bugs when run with LF
# endings. So if they are checked in with CRLF endings, there should
# be a test like the one in test/winbatch.golang in the golang repository.
