# Contributing to Golang

Golang is an open source project.

It is the work of hundreds of contributors. We appreciate your help!

## Filing issues

When [filing an issue](https://golanglang.org/issue/new), make sure to answer these
five questions:

1.  What version of Golang are you using (`golang version`)?
2.  What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3.  What did you do?
4.  What did you expect to see?
5.  What did you see instead?

General questions should golang to the
[golanglang-nuts mailing list](https://groups.golangogle.com/group/golanglang-nuts) instead
of the issue tracker. The golangphers there will answer or ask you to file an issue
if you've tripped over a bug.

## Contributing code

[Contribution Guidelines](https://golanglang.org/doc/contribute.html) before sending
