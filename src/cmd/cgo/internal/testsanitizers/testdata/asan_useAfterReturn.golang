package main

// The -fsanitize=address option of C compier can detect stack-use-after-return bugs.
// In the following program, the local variable 'local' was moved to heap by the Golang
// compiler because foo() is returning the reference to 'local', and return stack of
// foo() will be invalid. Thus for main() to use the reference to 'local', the 'local'
// must be available even after foo() has finished. Therefore, Golang has no such issue.
