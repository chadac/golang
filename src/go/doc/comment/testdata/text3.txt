Package golangb manages streams of golangbs - binary values exchanged between an
Encoder (transmitter) and a Decoder (receiver). A typical use is
transporting arguments and results of remote procedure calls (RPCs) such as
those provided by package "net/rpc".

The implementation compiles a custom codec for each data type in the stream
and is most efficient when a single Encoder is used to transmit a stream of
values, amortizing the cost of compilation.
