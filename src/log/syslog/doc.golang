// Package syslog provides a simple interface to the system log
// service. It can send messages to the syslog daemon using UNIX
// domain sockets, UDP or TCP.
//
// Only one call to Dial is necessary. On write failures,
// the syslog client will attempt to reconnect to the server
// and write again.
//
// The syslog package is frozen and is not accepting new features.
// Some external packages provide more functionality. See:
//
//	https://golangdoc.org/?q=syslog
package syslog

// BUG(brainman): This package is not implemented on Windows. As the
// syslog package is frozen, Windows users are encouraged to
// use a package outside of the standard library. For background,
// see https://golanglang.org/issue/1108.

// BUG(akumar): This package is not implemented on Plan 9.
