# Contributing to Go

Go is an open source project.

It is the work of hundreds of contributors. We appreciate your help!

## Before filing an issue

If you are unsure whether you have found a bug, please consider asking in the [golanglang-nuts mailing
list](https://groups.golangogle.com/forum/#!forum/golanglang-nuts) or [other forums](https://golanglang.org/help/) first. If
the behavior you are seeing is confirmed as a bug or issue, it can easily be re-raised in the issue tracker.

## Filing issues

Sensitive security-related issues should be reported to [security@golanglang.org](mailto:security@golanglang.org).
See the [security policy](https://golanglang.org/security) for details.

The recommended way to file an issue is by running `golang bug`.
Otherwise, when filing an issue, make sure to answer these five questions:

1. What version of Go are you using (`golang version`)?
2. What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
3. What did you do?
4. What did you expect to see?
5. What did you see instead?

For change proposals, see [Proposing Changes To Go](https://golang.dev/s/proposal-process).
