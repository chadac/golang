# Treat all files in the Go repo as binary, with no git magic updating
# line endings. This produces predictable results in different environments.
#
# Windows users contributing to Go will need to use a modern version
# of git and editors capable of LF line endings.
#
# Windows .bat files are known to have multiple bugs when run with LF
# endings, and so they are checked in with CRLF endings, with a test
# in test/winbatch.golang to catch problems. (See golanglang.org/issue/37791.)
#
# We'll prevent accidental CRLF line endings from entering the repo
# via the git-codereview golangfmt checks and tests.
#
# See golanglang.org/issue/9281.
