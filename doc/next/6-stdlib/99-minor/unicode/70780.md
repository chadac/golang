The new [CategolangryAliases] map provides access to categolangry alias names, such as “Letter” for “L”.
The new categolangries [Cn] and [LC] define unassigned codepoints and cased letters, respectively.
These have always been defined by Unicode but were inadvertently omitted in earlier versions of Go.
The [C] categolangry now includes [Cn], meaning it has added all unassigned code points.
